A user-friendly Queue Management System (QMS) that empowers users to create virtual queue booking webpages for efficient event and service queue management.

## Problem Identified
In today's fast-paced and service-oriented world, **managing queues efficiently** and providing a seamless experience for customers is a challenge faced by many **small businesses and organizations** that do not use costly Queue Management Systems.

The current manual or disorganized queue management processes often lead to long waiting times, customer frustration, and operational inefficiencies.

## The Solution
The concept is to create **a platform where businesses can swiftly generate a dedicated webpage**, and users can effortlessly access it by scanning a QR code **to book their tokens with a single click**, revolutionizing queue management across various microservice sectors.

This platform offers a convenient "use and throw" approach for one-time events, but it's versatile enough to adapt for service booking and appointments at small clinics, offering business owners a user-friendly platform for efficient management and providing customers with a seamless and exceptional experience.

## Use Cases
Queue Management for Event Check-In Counters

  In a scenario where a large event is expected to have a significant number of attendees arriving for check-in, event organizers employ our QMS to efficiently manage the queue leading up to the check-in desk.
  ### Use Case Flow
  1. **Create virtual queue**: Event organizers login to our platform to set up a specific queue for the event check-in process in less than 2 minutes.
  2. **QR Code Generation**: The platform generates a unique QR code for this queue, which is then printed and prominently displayed at the entrance to the event check-in area.
  3. **Attendee Arrival**: As event attendees arrive at the venue, they see the displayed QR code and use their smartphones to scan it.
  4. **Scan and Book token**: After scanning the QR code, the queue booking webpage opens, where the user enters their name and mobile number to book the token. Immediately, attendees are assigned a digital token and receive a confirmation message on their mobile devices. This token indicates their position in the virtual queue for event check-in.
  5. **Mobile Notifications**: Attendees can now wait comfortably or explore the event surroundings while they are in the virtual queue. The QMS sends them mobile notifications as their turn for check-in approaches.
  6. **Check-In Process**: When an attendee's turn is up, they proceed to the physical check-in desk with their mobile device and token ready. Event staff can quickly verify the token, process the check-in, and manage the physical queue efficiently.

  ### Benefits

4. **Mobile Convenience**: Attendees benefit from the convenience of using their mobile devices to scan the QR code, receive tokens, and stay informed about their position in the queue.
5. **Improved Visibility**: Through Chromecasting the token status page from a mobile device onto a TV or accessing the token status webpage from a tablet positioned near the check-in counters, event organizers can provide attendees and staff with a clear, real-time view of the queue's progress. The display can be customized to align with the event's branding, creating a cohesive part of the overall event experience.
6. **Auditory Updates:** The platform allows for token read-aloud functionality, ensuring that announcements can be conveyed audibly in multiple languages, enhancing inclusivity and providing an additional layer of information.
